# **App Name**: IoT Guardian

## Core Features:

- Behavior Baseline: Use a behavior modeling tool powered by AI to analyze IoT device network traffic and establish a baseline for normal operation.
- Anomaly Detection: Leverage anomaly detection algorithms to identify deviations from established behavior baselines, flagging potentially suspicious activities. The AI will use a device fingerprinting tool to aid this process.
- Real-time Dashboard: Provide a dashboard to display real-time monitoring data, flagged anomalies, and device information.
- Security Report: Present the user with a report on detected suspicious device behavior

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep blue (#3F51B5) to evoke trust and security.
- Background color: A very light gray (#F5F5F5) to create a clean, modern interface.
- Accent color: A vibrant orange (#FF9800) to highlight critical alerts and notifications.
